The TI 99 Cross-Development Tools (xdt99) are a small suite of programs that
facilitate the development of programs for the TI 99 family of home computers
on modern computer systems:

xas99  - TMS9900 cross-assembler
xga99  - GPL cross-assembler
xbas99 - TI BASIC and TI Extended BASIC lister and encoder
xda99  - TMS9900 disassembler
xdg99  - GPL disassembler
xdm99  - Disk manager for sector-based TI disk images
xhm99  - Manager for HFE images used by HxC floppy emulators
xvm99  - Volume manager for nanoPEB/CF7+ Compact Flash cards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EASYXDT99 is a docker compatible container image with a python interpreter
and some wrapper glue for easy access to the xdt99 command-line utilities.
It is meant to be an easy way to deploy xdt99 to multiple platforms without
doing manual software installation of the software and its dependencies.
