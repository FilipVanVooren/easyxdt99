EASYXDT99 by Filip Van Vooren

EASYXDT99 is a docker compatible container image with a python interpreter
and some wrapper glue for easy access to the xdt99 command-line utilities.
It is meant to be an easy way to deploy xdt99 to multiple platforms without
doing manual software installation of Python, xdt99 and its dependencies.
